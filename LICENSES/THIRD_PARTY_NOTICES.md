The bundled FFmpeg executable reports `--enable-gpl --enable-version3` and is therefore distributed under GPL v3, the same license as MMDirectEncoder. The full GPL v3 text is in `LICENSE`. Its complete build configuration can be displayed with `ffmpeg -version`.

OpenEXR, Imath, libdeflate, OpenJPH and DirectShow BaseClasses are distributed under permissive licenses that are compatible with GPL v3. Their copyright notices and license terms follow. The exact versions of OpenEXR and Imath are fetched and built by `build_deps.cmd`.
